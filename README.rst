Introduction
------------

`This gem <https://rubygems.org/gems/money-ecb>`_ is a RubyMoney_ bank that can
exchange ``Money`` using rates from the ECB (European Central Bank). It will
automatically keep the rates updated.

.. _RubyMoney: http://rubymoney.github.io/money

It is **not** production ready yet. Not because it isn't stable, but because I
might change the API. Wait a month or two. Or three :smile:

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: sh

    gem install money-ecb

In your ``Gemfile`` may want to have :ruby:`gem 'money-ecb', :require =>
'money/bank/ecb'`.

Dependencies
............

- RubyMoney's ``money`` gem
- ``rubyzip`` gem


Example
-------

Using Money and Monetize:

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'money'
    require 'money/bank/ecb'
    require 'monetize/core_extensions'

    Money.default_bank = Money::Bank::ECB.new

    puts '1 EUR'.to_money.exchange_to(:USD)


Rounding
--------

By default, :ruby:`Money::Bank`\ s will truncate. If you prefer to round:

.. code-block:: ruby

    puts '1 EUR'.to_money.exchange_to(:USD) {|x| x.round}

If you would like to have rounding done by default, you can set the default when
creating the bank:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Money.default_bank = Money::Bank::ECB.new {|x| x.round}

Local cache file
----------------

For your convenience, :ruby:`.new` will accept a string representing a file
path (or a :ruby:`Money::Bank::ECB::Cache`).

If the file path holds a valid CSV file with exchange rates, the rates will be
used for conversion (unless newer rates are availableâ€”see `auto-update`_). If
the file does not exist or is "somehow bogus", new rates will be downloaded from
the European Central Bank and stored in the file (or an
:ruby:`InvalidCacheError` will be raise if `auto-update`_ is off).


.. _`auto-update`:

Auto-update rates
-----------------

The European Central Bank publishes foreign exchange rates daily, and they
should be available at 14:00 CE(S)T. The cache is automatically updated when
doing an exchange after new rates has been published; to disable this, set
:ruby:`#auto_update = false`; to force, :ruby:`#update_cache` and
:ruby:`#reload` (or both in one take, :ruby:`#update`).

Also notice that when instantiating an :ruby:`ECB`, rates will be loaded from
the cache file, and if that fails, new rates will be fetched automatically. So
if you want to handle updating rates "by hand", you should place a valid cache
before :ruby:`.new` and then call :ruby:`#reload` after you updated the cache.

.. _`Can I code my own cache?`:

Can I code my own cache?
------------------------

Yes, have a look in ``lib/money/bank/ecb/``; just :ruby:`include
Money::Bank::ECB::Cache` and implement :ruby:`#set` and :ruby:`#get` and use
:ruby:`MyCache`:

.. code-block:: ruby

    cache = Money::Bank::ECB::MyCache.new(params)
    Money.default_bank = Money::Bank::ECB.new(cache)
